### Description

ELECTRO Maze is a very exciting game. You should re-construct the electric network to turn on all the lamps

in minimum number of mouse ticks. You will notice that all the tiles on the board are rotatable. The idea of this

game is based on a flash game called ConFuseBox. You can find it on http://www.ybbored.com/board/confusebox.

The electric network is built randomly. It is hard to see the same network twice. To play the game, just move

the mouse on a tile to get it focused. When you click it, it will be rotated according to the direction of the appearing

arrow when the mouse is nearby any corncer of the tile. If required, press any arrow key to move the window in the corresponding direction.

This game is designed by Wael Sayed. To send comments or suggestions, use the address wael_eng@hotmail.com .

Finally, special Thanks to Thejan J Rajapakshe <th>. He developped a very good vb code for

bitmaps rotations. I used it in my application.
